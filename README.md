# Multiple Launch Rocket System Simulation

The Cambridge rocketry simulator can be used to produce six-degree-of-freedom simulations of rocket flights, including the parachute descent. Simulations can also be run stochastically, generating splash-down plot. The Cambridge rocketry toolbox is a set of functions that can be run on either Octave or Matlab. OpenRocket is a fully featured model rocket simulator that allows you to design and simulate. RocketPy is the next-generation trajectory simulation solution for High-Power Rocketry. A Python-based simulation of a missile guidance system. CUDA Templates and Python DSLs for High-Performance Linear Algebra. MATLAB/Simulink simulation software for the flight dynamic simulation of an transsonic missile system.
