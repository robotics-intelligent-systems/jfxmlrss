# Multiple Launch Rocket System Simulation

MAPLEAF 6-DOF Rocket Flight Simulation Framework. GUI_Missile_Flyout is a stand-alone program running under Windows for simulating ballistic missiles with 1, 2, or 3 stages in a framework with a round, rotating Earth. The Cambridge rocketry simulator can be used to produce six-degree-of-freedom simulations of rocket flights, including the parachute descent. Simulations can also be run stochastically, generating splash-down plot. The Cambridge rocketry toolbox is a set of functions that can be run on either Octave or Matlab. OpenRocket is a fully featured model rocket simulator that allows you to design and simulate. RocketPy is the next-generation trajectory simulation solution for High-Power Rocketry. A Python-based simulation of a missile guidance system. CUDA Templates and Python DSLs for High-Performance Linear Algebra. MATLAB/Simulink simulation software for the flight dynamic simulation of an transsonic missile system. JSBSim Manager is a python module for automating the writing of these XML configuration files and running JSBSim efficiently in parallel. This is especially useful when you want to run thousands of simulations in a Monte-Carlo scheme
